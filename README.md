## Practicing Linear Regression on Used Car Prices

I used the sci-kit learn module for multiple linear regression analysis. The best predictor of car value in the data set is a multiple linear regression that finds a relationship between all of the included data and the price. The data for Cadillacs, Saturns, and SAABs are especially good predictors when combined, as they all have strong individual correlations to the price.
All of my findings, statistics, and plots are recorded in [this jupyter notebook](https://github.com/katjackson/car-worth-linear-regression/blob/master/car-worth.ipynb).
